// Greetings: Start with the array you used in Exercise 11, but instead of just printing each person’s name, print a message to them. The text of each message should be the same, but each message should be personalized with the person’s name.


let names: string[] = ["Zain ","Sam","Amaya"];
for (let name of names) {

    console.log(`Hello, ${name}! Have a great day!`);
}
